# Odin Learning Projects

This folder contains all code projects, exercises, and assignments completed as part of The Odin Project curriculum.

## Structure
- Organize by course and project, for example (`<course_number>_<course_name>/<chapter_number>_<chapter_name>/<project_name>/`):
  - Eg. `01_foundations/04_html_foundations/html_boilerplate/`

Add a `README.md` in each project folder with a short description and assignment link.
