# Learning Plan

This folder contains my personalized learning plan and progress tracking for The Odin Project curriculum.

## Structure
- Each Markdown file represents a course (`<course_number>_<course_name>.md`), with chapters and topics listed in order.
- Progress is tracked by marking topics as in progress, completed, or with notes for follow-up.
- Update these files as you move through the curriculum.

### Example Structure
```
learning_plan/
  overview.md           # High-level summary of your current progress
  01_foundations.md     # Progress for Foundations course
  02_intermediate_html_css.md
  ...
```

**Tip:** Always check `overview.md` to know where you are in the curriculum.
