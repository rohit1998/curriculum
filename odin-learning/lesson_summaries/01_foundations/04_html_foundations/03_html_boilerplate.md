# HTML Boilerplate

**Date Completed:** July 4, 2025

## Key Summary
- Every HTML document starts with a standard boilerplate: `<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>`.
- The homepage file should be named `index.html` so web servers serve it by default.
- The `<meta charset="UTF-8">` tag ensures correct character encoding.
- The `<meta name="viewport">` tag is important for responsive design on mobile devices.
- The `<title>` tag sets the browser tab name.
- Use Chrome for testing and practice writing the boilerplate by hand before using shortcuts.

## Knowledge Checks
- **What is the purpose of the doctype declaration?**  
  The doctype tells the browser that the file is an HTML document and specifies the HTML version to use for rendering. For HTML5, `<!DOCTYPE html>` is used. This helps browsers interpret the markup correctly and avoid quirks mode.

- **What is the HTML element?**  
  The `<html>` element is the root element of an HTML document. All other elements are nested inside it. HTML elements are the building blocks of a web page, such as paragraphs (`<p>`), tables (`<table>`), headings, etc.

- **What is the purpose of the head element?**  
  The `<head>` element contains meta-information about the document that is not displayed directly on the web page, such as the title, character encoding, links to stylesheets, and scripts.

- **What is the purpose of the body element?**  
  The `<body>` element contains all the content that is displayed to the user in the browser window, such as text, images, links, and other visible elements.

## Python vs JS Notes
- No direct Python vs JS notes for this lesson, but understanding file naming conventions and default behaviors is important in both web and backend development.
