# Lists

**Date completed:** 7 July 2025

## Key Summary
- HTML provides two main types of lists: unordered (`<ul>`) and ordered (`<ol>`).
- Unordered lists are for items where order does not matter (e.g., shopping lists) and use bullet points.
- Ordered lists are for items where order matters (e.g., instructions, rankings) and use numbers.
- Both types use the `<li>` element for each list item.
