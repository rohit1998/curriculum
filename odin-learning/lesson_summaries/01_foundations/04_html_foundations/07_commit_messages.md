**Date completed:** July 11, 2025

## Key Summary
Commit messages are short descriptions you write when saving a snapshot of your code with Git. Good commit messages help you and others understand what changed and why, making it easier to debug, review, or revisit code. Employers also look at your commit history to gauge your professionalism.

- Use an **active voice** (e.g., "Fix bug in login form") for clarity and directness.
- A good commit message has:
  - **Subject:** Brief summary (ideally under 72 characters)
  - **Body:** (Optional) Concise explanation of why the change was made, separated by a blank line
- Commit early and oftenâ€”whenever you make a meaningful change.

## Knowledge Checks

- How many characters should the subject line of your commit message be?

## My Answers
1. Well-written commit messages help us and others keep track of what changes are being made. A good commit history allows us to roll back, debug, and improves overall maintainability.
2. The subject line should ideally be under 50 characters, with 72 as a hard limit.
