## Knowledge Checks
1. What element is used to create a link?
   - The `<a>` (anchor) element.
2. What is an attribute?
   - An attribute provides extra information or functionality to an HTML element, such as `href` for links or `src` for images.
3. What attribute tells links where to go to?
   - The `href` attribute.
4. What security considerations must be taken if you wish to use the target attribute to open links in a new tab/window?
   - Always use `rel="noopener noreferrer"` with `target="_blank"` to prevent the new page from accessing your page and to hide the referrer for privacy and security.
5. What is the difference between an absolute and relative link?
   - Absolute links include the full URL (e.g., `https://google.com`) and are used for external sites. Relative links are paths relative to the current file and are used for internal navigation.
6. Which element is used to display an image?
   - The `<img>` element.
7. What two attributes do images always need to have?
   - `src` (source of the image) and `alt` (alternate text for accessibility).

   - Use `../` to move up one directory level.
9. What are the four main image formats that you can use for images on the web?
