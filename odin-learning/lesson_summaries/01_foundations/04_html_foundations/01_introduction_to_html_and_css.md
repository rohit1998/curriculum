# Introduction to HTML and CSS

**Date Completed:** July 4, 2025

## Key Summary
- HTML (HyperText Markup Language) structures the content of web pages (text, images, links, etc.).
- CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) styles and visually arranges HTML content (colors, fonts, layout, responsiveness).
- JavaScript adds interactivity and dynamic behavior, manipulating both HTML and CSS.
- HTML and CSS are not programming languages; JavaScript is.
- All three are essential for modern web development, each with a distinct role.

## Python vs JS Notes
- Python is a general-purpose programming language; HTML and CSS are for web structure and style, not logic.
- JavaScript is the browser's scripting language, while Python is typically used server-side (though can be used client-side with tools like Brython).
