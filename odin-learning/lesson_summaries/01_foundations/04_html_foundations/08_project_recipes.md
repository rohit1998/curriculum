**Date completed:** July 11, 2025

## Key Summary
This project focused on building a multi-page recipe website using only HTML. The main goals were to practice structuring content with semantic HTML, organizing files and folders, and linking pages together. You also reinforced good habits like using descriptive alt text for images, adding navigation, and keeping your code clean and readable. The project also encouraged meaningful commit messages and a logical folder structure, which are essential for real-world web development.
