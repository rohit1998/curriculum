# Block and Inline

**Date completed:** July 15, 2025

## Key Summary
- Block elements (e.g., `div`, `p`, `h1`) start on a new line, take up the full width, and allow all margin/padding properties.
- Inline elements (e.g., `span`, `a`, `strong`) flow within a line, only take up as much width as their content, and only horizontal margin/padding applies.
- Inline-block elements combine inline flow with block-like sizing and margin/padding.
- The `display` property controls how elements behave.
- Understanding these differences is fundamental for CSS layout and page structure.

## My Answers to Knowledge Checks

1. **What is the difference between a block element and an inline element?**
   - Block elements always start on a new line, take up the full width, and allow all four margins and paddings. Inline elements do not start on a new line, only take up as much width as their content, and only horizontal margin/padding works (vertical is ignored).

2. **What is the difference between an inline element and an inline-block element?**
   - Both do not start a new line, but inline-block elements allow you to set width, height, and all four margins and paddings, while inline elements do not.
