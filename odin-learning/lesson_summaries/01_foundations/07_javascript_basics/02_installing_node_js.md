# Installing Node.js

**Date completed:** July 16, 2025

## Key Summary
Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that lets you run JS outside the browser, essential for backend development and tooling. nvm (Node Version Manager) is recommended for managing Node versions, but you can use a direct install if you only need one version. npm (Node Package Manager) comes bundled with Node.js and is used for installing libraries and tools. The lesson covered installing nvm, Node.js (LTS), and npm, verifying installation, and using the Node REPL for quick code testing.
