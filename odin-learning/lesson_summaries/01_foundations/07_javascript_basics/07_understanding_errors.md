# Understanding Errors

**Date completed:** July 17, 2025

## Key Summary
- JavaScript errors are essential for debugging and learning.
- Three main error types: ReferenceError (undeclared/out-of-scope variable), SyntaxError (invalid code structure), TypeError (wrong type or inappropriate operation).
- Use browser dev tools and `console.log()` to debug.
- Read error messages carefully; they often point to the exact problem and location.
- Fixing errors is a normal part of development—don’t get discouraged!

## Assignments
- [x] Read MDN docs for ReferenceError, SyntaxError, and TypeError
- [x] Work through "What went wrong? Troubleshooting JavaScript" article

## Knowledge Checks
- **Three reasons for TypeError:** Wrong type passed to function, using a method/property that doesn’t exist for a type, trying to modify a read-only value.
- **Difference between error and warning:** Errors stop code execution; warnings highlight potential issues but don’t halt the program.
- **Method to resolve an error:** Read the error message, use dev tools, and debug with `console.log()`.
