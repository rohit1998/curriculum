# Clean Code

**Date completed:** July 23, 2025

## Key Summary

Clean code is readable, maintainable, and easy for others to understand. It helps with collaboration and future maintenance. Key principles include:
- Write comments that explain "why" decisions are made, not "how" (the code should show how).
- Use clear, consistent naming conventions for variables and functions.
- Keep functions focused on a single job; refactor large or complex functions.
- Refactor code to make it easy to understand without relying on comments.
- Keep coding languages (HTML, CSS, JS) separated for clarity.
- Minimize imports to reduce clutter and improve performance.
