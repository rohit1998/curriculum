# JavaScript Developer Tools

**Date completed:** July 17, 2025

## Key Summary
- DevTools are built into browsers and help you inspect, debug, and optimize web pages.
- You can open DevTools using F12, right-click → Inspect, Ctrl+Shift+I, or via the browser menu.
- Device Mode lets you simulate mobile/tablet screens, resize the viewport, and test responsiveness.
- Breakpoints pause JavaScript execution so you can inspect variables, call stack, and step through code. You can set breakpoints on lines, events, network requests, or exceptions.
- The Console panel acts as a JavaScript interpreter, displays logs/errors, and lets you run arbitrary code, create variables, and interact with the DOM.
