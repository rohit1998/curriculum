**Date completed:** July 17, 2025

## Key Summary
- Functions are reusable blocks of code for organizing logic and avoiding repetition.
- You can create functions using declarations, expressions, and arrow functions.
- Parameters are placeholders; arguments are actual values passed in.
- Functions can return values using `return`.
- Scope determines variable visibility (local vs global).
- Arrow functions provide concise syntax and inherit `this` from their parent scope.
- The call stack manages function execution order (LIFO).
