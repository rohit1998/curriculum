# Problem Solving

**Date completed:** July 17, 2025

## Key Summary
Problem solving is the most important skill for developers. The process involves three main steps: understanding the problem, planning (including writing pseudocode), and dividing the problem into smaller subproblems. Pseudocode helps clarify logic before coding. Breaking problems down makes them easier to solve and debug.

## Knowledge Checks
- **Three stages in problem solving:** Understand, Plan, Divide and conquer
- **Importance of understanding the problem:** You can't solve what you don't understand; prevents wasted effort and wrong solutions.
- **How to get clearer understanding:** Rephrase, explain to someone, draw diagrams, list constraints, ask questions.
- **Planning stage actions:** Define inputs/outputs, sketch UI, write algorithm/pseudocode, break into subproblems, consider edge cases.
- **Algorithm:** Step-by-step solution to a problem.
- **Pseudocode:** Easy-to-read, plain language description of logic, using basic programming constructs.
- **Advantages of breaking down problems:** Easier to solve, less overwhelming, easier to debug, reusable solutions, find help online for subproblems.
