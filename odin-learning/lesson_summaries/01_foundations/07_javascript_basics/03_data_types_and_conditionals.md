# Data Types and Conditionals

**Date completed:** July 16, 2025

## Key Summary
This lesson covered the fundamental data types in JavaScript, including primitive and non-primitive types, string manipulation, logical and comparison operators, and the use of conditionals for decision-making. You practiced with exercises and reviewed how to use if/else, switch, and ternary operators, as well as the concept of nesting blocks for complex logic.

## Assignment List
- [x] 01_helloWorld
- [x] 02_addNumbers
- [x] 03_numberChecker
- [x] 04_mathEquations
- [x] 05_joinStrings

## Knowledge Checks
- Eight data types in JavaScript: number, string, object, symbol, null, undefined, boolean, BigInt
- Object is not a primitive data type
- Null vs undefined: null is explicit no value, undefined is uninitialized
- Single/double/backtick quotes: backticks allow embedding and multi-line
- Concatenation joins strings
- Backticks and `${}` embed variables/expressions
- Escape characters use backslash (`\`)
- `slice` allows negative indices, `substring` does not
- Logical operators: `||` (OR), `&&` (AND), `!` (NOT)
- Comparison operators: `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, `==`, `===`, `!=`, `!==`
- Truthy/falsy values: falsy are `false`, `0`, `-0`, `""`, `null`, `undefined`, `NaN`
- Conditionals: if/else, switch, ternary
- Syntax for if/else, switch, ternary provided
- Nesting: placing one block inside another for complex logic
