# Loops and Arrays

**Date completed:** July 25, 2025

## Key Summary
- Loops automate repetitive tasks, making code concise and efficient.
- Arrays are special objects for storing ordered collections of values, accessible by index.
- Useful array methods include `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, `sort`, `indexOf`, and more.
- Loops and array methods are often used together to process and transform data.
- Automated tests help catch bugs and ensure code reliability.

## Knowledge Checks & My Answers
1. **What are loops useful for?**
   - Loops are useful to perform same operations repeatedly.
2. **What is the break statement?**
   - Break statement exits the loop when it is executed.
3. **What is the continue statement?**
   - Continue statement skips the code below it in loop block and moves to the next iteration of loop.
4. **What is an array?**
   - Array is an object in JS that can store multiple values.
5. **What are arrays useful for?**
   - Arrays are useful for storing and operating on indefinite number of variables without explicitly naming each one.
6. **How do you access or change an array element?**
   - You can update ith element by arr[i] = <new_value>.
7. **What are some useful array methods?**
   - filter, map, reduce, sort, indexOf, etc.
8. **What is the advantage of writing automated tests?**
   - Modular way of testing code and catching regressions systematically.
