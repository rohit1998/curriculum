# DOM Manipulation and Events

**Date completed:** (in progress)

## Key Summary

- The DOM (Document Object Model) is a tree-like structure representing the contents of a web page. JavaScript can access and manipulate this structure to change content, structure, and style dynamically.
- Nodes are the building blocks of the DOM. Most DOM manipulation involves element nodes (like `<div>`, `<p>`, etc.).
- You use selectors (like CSS selectors) to find and reference elements in the DOM using methods like `querySelector` and `querySelectorAll`.
- You can create, add, remove, and alter elements and their attributes, classes, and styles using JavaScript methods (`createElement`, `appendChild`, `removeChild`, `setAttribute`, etc.).
- Events are actions that happen in the browser (like clicks, key presses, etc.). You can make your page respond to these events by attaching event listeners to elements.
- The preferred way to handle events is with `addEventListener`, which allows multiple handlers and keeps your HTML and JS separate.
- `querySelectorAll` returns a NodeList, which is similar to an array but not exactly the same. You can convert it to an array if needed.
- Event bubbling is the process where events propagate up the DOM tree, which is important for advanced event handling.
