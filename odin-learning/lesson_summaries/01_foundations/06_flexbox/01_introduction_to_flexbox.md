# Introduction to Flexbox

**Date completed:** July 15, 2025

## Key Summary
- **Flexbox** is a modern CSS layout system for arranging elements efficiently, especially for flexible and responsive designs.
- A **flex container** is any element with `display: flex`. It controls the layout of its direct children (the **flex items**).
- Flexbox makes it easy to align, distribute, and size elements in rows or columns, and to create layouts that adapt to different screen sizes.
- Properties are divided between the container (e.g., direction, alignment) and the items (e.g., grow, shrink, order).
- Flexbox is now the default tool for most web layouts and is widely supported.

## My Answers to Knowledge Checks

1. **What’s the difference between a flex container and a flex item?**
   - A flex container is the high-level container in which other elements are placed. A flex item is any element that is a direct child of the flex container.

2. **How do you create a flex item?**
   - You create a flex container by giving it `display: flex`. Any element that is a direct child of this container automatically becomes a flex item; you don’t need to explicitly mark it.
