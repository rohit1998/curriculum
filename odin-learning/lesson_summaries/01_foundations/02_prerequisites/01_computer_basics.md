## Key Summary

This foundational lesson covered basic computer concepts essential for web development. As an experienced programmer, these concepts were already familiar but good to review in the context of web development.

**Topics Covered:**
- Computer software and hardware fundamentals
- How to take screenshots (important for documentation and getting help)
- The importance of strong passwords (critical for web application security)

**Web Development Context:**
- Screenshots are essential for documenting projects and asking for help in developer communities
- Strong password practices become even more important when deploying web applications
- Understanding software/hardware helps with deployment and server management later

## Knowledge Check Answers

1. **Is Windows an operating system or an application?**
   - Answer: Operating system

2. **What's the difference between open source and closed source software?**
   - Answer: In open source software you can see the code. In closed source you don't have luxury of viewing the code.

3. **What are some use cases of a screenshot?**
   - Answer: To share things with others, save things for your own personal use, show AI something.

4. **Give an example of a weak and a strong password.**
   - Answer: Strong passwords have uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, special characters and don't have common words. Weak passwords are very repetitive patterns like 12345678 or ABC.

## Python vs JS Notes

These concepts are language-agnostic fundamentals that apply equally to both Python and JavaScript development.

## Notes

This lesson was straightforward given my 6 years of programming experience. The main value was understanding how these basics apply specifically to web development contexts, particularly around documentation (screenshots) and security (passwords).
