# Command Line Basics

**Completed:** January 4, 2025

## Key Summary
- Command Line Interface (CLI) is essential for web development workflow
- Terminal shortcuts: tab completion, copy/paste, opening files in VS Code
- File/directory operations: navigate, create, modify, delete files and folders
- VS Code integration: `code .` command to open projects
- Base of operations for Git, installations, and daily development tasks

## Assignment Checklist
- [x] Software Carpentry lessons (skipped - already experienced) ✅
- [x] Practice creating web project structure (already familiar) ✅
- [x] Practice exercise with test directory (already familiar) ✅

## Knowledge Check Answers

1. **What is a command line interface?**
   - A command line interface (CLI) is a text-based interface where users interact with the computer by typing commands instead of using a graphical user interface (GUI) with windows, icons, and menus.

2. **What is the difference between a terminal and a shell?**
   - A terminal is the interface or window that provides access to the command line, while a shell is the program that interprets those commands (like bash, zsh, fish, etc.).

3. **What is the difference between a file and a directory?**
   - A file is a logical unit that holds some information, while a directory is a collection of files.

4. **What is the command to create a new directory?**
   - `mkdir directory_path`

5. **What is the command to navigate to a specific directory?**
   - `cd directory_path`

6. **What is the command to list the contents of a directory?**
   - `ls directory_path`

7. **What is the command to remove a file?**
   - `rm file_path` (for files)
   - `rm -r directory_path` (for directories)

8. **What is the command to display the current working directory?**
   - `pwd`

9. **What is the command to move or rename a file?**
   - `mv initial_path final_path`

10. **What is the command to copy a file?**
    - `cp initial_file_path target_file_path`

11. **What is the command to display the contents of a file?**
    - `cat file_path`

12. **What is the command to clear the terminal screen?**
    - `clear`

## Python vs JS Notes
- Command line usage transfers directly from Python/ML work
- Similar workflow: terminal as central hub for development tasks
- Web dev uses CLI more extensively for Git, npm, deployment
- VS Code integration (`code .`) will be useful for web projects
- Tab completion and shortcuts already familiar from Python development

## Key Insights
- **Already experienced**: 6+ years of command line usage from Python/ML work
- **Web dev focus**: CLI is even more central to web development workflow
- **VS Code integration**: `code .` command for opening projects will be useful
- **Foundation for Git**: Command line skills prepare for upcoming Git lessons
