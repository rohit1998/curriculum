## Date Completed
July 2, 2025

## Key Summary
This lesson teaches how to effectively ask programming questions to get helpful answers:

- **Well-Formed Questions**: Asking good questions is a skill that will serve you throughout your programming career.
- **Provide Context and Code**: Always include your code, error messages, and relevant details.
- **Ask About the Problem, Not the Solution**: This helps avoid the "XY Problem" where you ask about your attempted solution rather than your actual problem.
- **What Makes a Good Question**:
  1. Link to the lesson/project you're working on
  2. Include your code or pseudo-code
  3. Explain the problem clearly
  4. Describe what you expected to happen
  5. Summarize what you've already tried
- **After Asking**: Stay online, be patient, provide more details when asked, and avoid asking follow-up questions without research.

## Knowledge Checks
1. **What is the "XY Problem"?**
   - XY problem is when you have a problem X and you have a solution Y. So you're asking about the solution Y, and it confuses people rather than you should be asking about the Problem X all along.

2. **What 5 things should your questions include?**
   - Link to the lesson/project in the curriculum
   - Code or pseudo-code and other relevant information
   - Explanation of the problem
   - Description of what you expect to happen
   - Summary of what you've already tried
