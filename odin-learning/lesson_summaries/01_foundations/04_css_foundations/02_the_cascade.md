# The Cascade

**Date completed:** July 14, 2025

## Key Summary
- The cascade determines which CSS rules are applied when multiple rules target the same element.
- Specificity is calculated based on IDs, classes/attributes/pseudo-classes, and type selectors. Higher specificity wins.
- Inheritance means some properties (like color, font-family) are passed from parent to child unless directly overridden.
- If specificity is tied, the rule that comes last in the stylesheet wins.
- Direct targeting always beats inherited values, regardless of order or specificity.
