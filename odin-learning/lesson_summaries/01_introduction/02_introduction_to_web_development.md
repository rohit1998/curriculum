# Introduction to Web Development

**Date Completed:** July 2, 2025

## Key Summary
- Web developers build and maintain websites for clients and organizations
- Three main types of developers:
  - Front-end (HTML, CSS, JavaScript - what users see)
  - Back-end (server-side code, databases - using languages like Python, Ruby, Java)
  - Full-stack (both front and back end - what The Odin Project teaches)
- Career paths include large tech companies, startups, freelancing, consultancies, and traditional companies
- Essential tools include text editors, CLI, Git/GitHub, and Stack Overflow
- The Odin Project offers a realistic, comprehensive approach with community-improved content
- Learning to code is challenging but rewarding, requiring persistence and problem-solving skills

## Python vs JavaScript Notes
- As a Python developer, you already have strong programming fundamentals
- New areas to focus on will be front-end technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
- Your back-end knowledge will be valuable, but you'll need to learn JavaScript-specific server technologies
- Python and JavaScript are both high-level languages, but with different syntax and paradigms
