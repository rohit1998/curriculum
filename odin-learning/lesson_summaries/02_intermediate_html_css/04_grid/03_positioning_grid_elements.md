# Positioning Grid Elements

**Date completed:** September 17, 2025

## Key Summary
- CSS Grid layouts use tracks (rows/columns), lines (boundaries), and cells (smallest unit).
- Items are positioned using grid line numbers, either explicitly (e.g., `grid-column: 1 / 3`) or with named areas (`grid-template-areas`).
- Shorthand properties like `grid-area` combine start/end values for rows and columns.
- `grid-template-areas` visually maps the layout using named areas.

## Assignments
- [x] Read MDNâ€™s Line-based Placement with CSS Grid
- [x] Completed CSS exercise: 01-basic-holy-grail

## Knowledge Checks
- **Track vs. Line:** Track is the space between two lines; lines are boundaries used for positioning.
- **Smallest unit:** Grid cell (intersection of a row and column track).
- **Values for grid-column-start/end:** Grid line numbers (e.g., 1, 2, 3), named lines, or `span`.
- **Property to combine start/end values:** `grid-area`.
- **Property to map visual structure:** `grid-template-areas`.

## Open Questions / Struggles
- None for this topic.
