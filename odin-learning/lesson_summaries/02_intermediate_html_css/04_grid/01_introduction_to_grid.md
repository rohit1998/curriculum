## Topic title
Introduction to Grid

## Key Summary
CSS Grid is a two-dimensional layout system that makes arranging items in rows and columns straightforward. It's suited for complex layouts where both axes matter. Grid and Flexbox complement each other: Flexbox is ideal for one-dimensional alignment; Grid for two-dimensional. Grid introduced useful features like explicit row/column tracks, the `gap` property, and powerful placement options.

## Assignment List

- [ ] Work through any example exercises in the lesson

## Knowledge Checks
- How can you use Flex to make a two-dimensional layout?
- Why was CSS Grid introduced?
- Which CSS layout module would you use to easily make equal sized items in a container?

## My Answers to Knowledge Checks
1. You can use Flexbox to make a two-dimensional layout by enabling `flex-wrap`. When items run out of space in the main direction, Flexbox wraps them onto a new line, creating a multi-row or multi-column effect. However, each row or column is independent, so aligning items across both axes can be tricky.

2. CSS Grid was introduced because Flexbox mainly handles one-dimensional layouts. Creating true two-dimensional layouts (rows and columns together) with Flexbox was difficult and required workarounds. Grid solves this by providing direct control over both axes, making complex layouts easier and more maintainable.

3. To easily make equal-sized items in a container, you would use CSS Grid. Grid lets you define rows and columns with equal sizes, and automatically arranges items to fit perfectly across both dimensions.

Feedback: All answers are correct! Flexbox can mimic 2D layouts but is limited; Grid was made for true 2D control; and Grid is the best choice for equal-sized, multi-row/column layouts.
