## Key Summary
HTML tables are used to display tabular data in rows and columns. They provide semantic structure for data relationships and include elements like `<table>`, `<tr>`, `<td>`, and `<th>`. Tables should be used for actual data presentation, not page layout, and include accessibility features for screen readers.

## My Answers

1. **What is a table?**
   - A table element lets us create a tabular structure in a web page that is composed of rows and columns.

2. **Why is it a bad idea to use HTML Tables for page layout?**
   - They are not semantically rich and there are much better and cleaner algorithms like flexbox and grid.

3. **What are caption elements useful for?**
   - Caption elements do two things: they put a summary or caption at the top of the table, and they help screen readers understand what the table is about.

4. **What is the scope attribute?**
   - The scope attribute tells us the scope of a header cell - whether it's a row header or column header, defining what data that header describes.
