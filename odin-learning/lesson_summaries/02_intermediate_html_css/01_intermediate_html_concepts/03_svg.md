## Key Summary

SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) is a vector-based image format that uses mathematical formulas instead of pixels to define images. Key concepts:

### What SVGs Are
- **Vector Graphics**: Images defined by math formulas rather than pixel grids
- **XML-based**: Written in XML, making them human-readable and HTML-compatible
- **Scalable**: Can be resized to any dimension without quality loss
- **Programmable**: Can be styled with CSS and manipulated with JavaScript

### Common Use Cases
1. Icons and logos
2. Charts and graphs
3. Simple illustrations
4. Patterned backgrounds
5. SVG filters for effects

### Key Benefits
- Perfect scalability without file size increase
- Small file sizes for simple graphics
- Can be styled with CSS
- Can be animated and made interactive
- Human-readable code

### Drawbacks
- Inefficient for complex/photo-realistic images
- Every detail must be written as XML code
- Not suitable for images with fine textures

### SVG Anatomy
- `xmlns`: XML namespace declaration
- `viewBox`: Defines coordinate system and aspect ratio
- Basic elements: `<circle>`, `<rect>`, `<path>`, `<text>`, etc.
- Attributes can be styled with CSS

### Embedding Methods
1. **Linked**: Using `<img>` tag or CSS `background-image` (simpler, cacheable)
2. **Inline**: Paste SVG code directly in HTML (allows full CSS/JS control)

## Knowledge Check Questions
- [✅] What is the xmlns attribute? ✅ **Answered:** XML NameSpace - specifies SVG dialect/syntax for the browser
- [✅] What are some situations where you wouldn't want to use SVG? ✅ **Answered:** Complex patterns, photographic images, highly detailed artwork 
- [✅] What are the benefits of "inlining" your SVGs? What are the drawbacks? ✅ **Answered:** Benefits: Full CSS/JS control, no HTTP request. Drawbacks: Messy code, harder to maintain, not cacheable
