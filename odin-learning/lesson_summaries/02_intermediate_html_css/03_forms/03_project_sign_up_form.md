# Project: Sign-up Form

**Date Started:** September 2, 2025  
**Date Completed:** September 4, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Completed

## Summary

This project provides hands-on practice with form creation, styling, and validation using the concepts learned in previous form lessons. You'll be building a sign-up form for an imaginary service, implementing both HTML structure and CSS styling.

## Project Overview

Create a responsive sign-up form that includes:
- A background image section with logo
- Form fields for user registration
- Form validation styling
- Professional visual design

## Assignment Breakdown

### ☐ Step 1: Set up and planning
1. **Set up git repository** - Initialize project with proper version control
2. **Create HTML and CSS files** - Set up basic structure with dummy content to test linking
3. **Download design file** - Get the [design reference](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/afdbabfab03fbc34783c6b6f3920aba4a4d3b935/intermediate_html_css/forms/project_sign_up_form/imgs/sign-up-form.png) and plan HTML layout

### ☐ Step 2: Gather assets
1. **Background image** - Find and download a large background image (original from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/photos/25xggax4bSA) or choose your own)
2. **Logo font** - Select external font for logo section ([Norse Bold](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/theodinproject/efdc2888072f409e687d31dc580595dbe4fe0ff4/app/assets/fonts/Norse-Bold.otf) or alternative)
3. **Odin logo** - Download [Odin logo](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/5f37d43908ef92499e95a9b90fc3cc291a95014c/html_css/project-sign-up-form/odin-lined.png) for sidebar

### ☐ Step 3: Implementation
1. **Structure scaffolding** - Create overall page layout
2. **Section-by-section development** - Build each part incrementally
3. **Logo section styling** - Semi-transparent background for readability
4. **Form styling** - Implement the specified design requirements

## Key Technical Requirements

### Colors and Styling
- **Button color:** `#596D48` (matches background image tones)
- **Default input border:** `#E5E7EB` (light border)
- **Invalid inputs:** Red border using `:invalid` pseudo-class
- **Selected inputs:** Blue border and subtle box-shadow using `:focus` pseudo-class

### Form Validation
- Individual field validation (no password matching validation yet - requires JavaScript)
- Visual feedback for valid/invalid states
- Proper use of HTML5 form validation attributes

### Layout Notes
- Semi-transparent background behind logo for text readability
- No mobile responsiveness required (covered later in curriculum)
- Focus on desktop layout and functionality

## Learning Objectives

- Apply form creation and validation concepts
- Practice CSS layout and styling techniques
- Implement user interface design from mockup
- Use pseudo-classes for interactive states
- Work with external fonts and images
