## Key Summary

CSS units are measurement systems for defining sizes, distances, and dimensions. They fall into two main categories:

### Absolute Units
- **px (pixels)** - The only absolute unit you should use for web development
- Fixed size that doesn't change based on context
- Good for borders, small decorative elements

### Relative Units
- **em** - Relative to current element's font size (or parent's if setting font-size)
- **rem** - Relative to root element's font size (more predictable than em)
- **vh (viewport height)** - 1vh = 1% of viewport height
- **vw (viewport width)** - 1vw = 1% of viewport width

### Key Principles
- Prefer `rem` over `em` for consistency
- Use relative units for accessibility (respects user font size preferences)
- Use viewport units for full-screen layouts
- Use `px` for borders and fixed decorative elements

## My Answers

### 1. Why would you want to use em or rem for font-size instead of px?
Em and rem are relative font sizes that respond when users zoom in/out, making them more responsive than px. The key reason is **accessibility** - many users increase their browser's default font size for better readability (vision issues, preferences). When you use rem for font-sizes, your text respects their settings, while px ignores user preferences completely.

### 2. What are some instances where you might want to use vh and vw?
- **Full-screen layouts** where you need to work with exact viewport dimensions (like 100vh for app-like interfaces)
- **Hero sections** that take up specific portions of screen height (e.g., min-height: 80vh)
- **Responsive typography** using calc() functions to scale fonts with viewport size
- **Breaking containers** technique (calc(50% - 50vw)) to make elements span full width
- Any time you need precise control over screen real estate

### 3. What are some instances where you might want to use px instead of a relative unit?
- **Spacing** - gaps, paddings, and margins (Cody Loyd's recommendation for consistent layouts)
- **Borders** - 1px borders shouldn't scale with font size
- **Small decorative elements** that need to stay fixed
- **Complex layouts** where relative units cause problems with scaling
- **Icons and fixed UI elements** that should remain consistent
- When your design doesn't work well with relative scaling behavior
