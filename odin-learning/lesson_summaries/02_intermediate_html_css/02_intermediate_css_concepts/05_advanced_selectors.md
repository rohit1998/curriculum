# Advanced Selectors

**Date completed:** August 4, 2025

## Key Summary

Advanced CSS selectors provide powerful ways to target elements in your HTML for styling, beyond basic type, class, and ID selectors. They help you write more maintainable and flexible CSS, especially when you can't or don't want to change your HTML markup.

### Main Concepts
- **Combinators:**
  - `>` (child): Selects direct children only (e.g., `main > div`).
  - `+` (adjacent sibling): Selects the next sibling (e.g., `.item + .item`).
  - `~` (general sibling): Selects all following siblings (e.g., `.item ~ .item`).
- **Pseudo-classes:**
  - Target elements based on state or position (e.g., `:hover`, `:focus`, `:nth-child()`, `:first-child`, `:last-child`).
- **Pseudo-elements:**
  - Target parts of elements (e.g., `::before`, `::after`, `::first-letter`, `::selection`).
- **Attribute selectors:**
  - Select elements by attribute and value (e.g., `[type="text"]`, `[src$=".jpg"]`, `[class^="aus"]`).

These selectors allow for precise, context-aware styling without extra classes or IDs, making your CSS more robust and expressive.
