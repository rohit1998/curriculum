# Browser Compatibility

**Date completed:** August 6, 2025

## Key Summary
- Browser compatibility means ensuring your site works across different browsers and devices.
- Each browser uses its own rendering engine (e.g., Chrome uses Blink, Safari uses WebKit), which can cause differences in how sites appear and behave.
- On iOS, all browsers must use WebKit, so Chrome/Firefox/Edge are just Safari with different skins. On Android, browsers can use their own engines.
- The W3C sets web standards, but browsers implement features at their own pace. Use [Can I Use](https://caniuse.com/) to check support for new features.
- Always test your site in multiple browsers and devices, especially mobile.
