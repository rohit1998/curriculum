# Frameworks and Preprocessors

**Date completed:** August 6, 2025

## Key Summary

- CSS frameworks provide pre-defined styles and components (e.g., buttons, layouts) for rapid UI development. You use their classes in your HTML to apply styles. Examples: Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS, Bulma, Foundation.
- CSS preprocessors (Sass, LESS, Stylus) extend CSS with programming features like variables, nesting, mixins, and functions. You write code in their syntax, which is compiled to vanilla CSS for browsers.
- Frameworks help with speed and consistency, but can make sites look similar and may limit customization.
- Preprocessors make large codebases easier to manage, but add complexity and require a build step.
- Disadvantages of preprocessors include harder debugging, slower compilation, larger generated files, extra tooling, and maintenance overhead.
- At this stage, focus on mastering vanilla CSS before relying heavily on frameworks or preprocessors.
