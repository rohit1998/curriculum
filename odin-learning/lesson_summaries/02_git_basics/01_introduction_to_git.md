# Introduction to Git

**Date completed:** July 4, 2025

## Key Summary
- Git is a version control system that tracks changes to files and directories, allowing you to review, restore, and collaborate efficiently.
- GitHub is a remote platform for hosting Git repositories online, enabling sharing, collaboration, and portfolio building.
- Git works locally; GitHub is remote. You “push” your local changes to GitHub.
- Git is useful for individuals (track progress, experiment, recover from mistakes) and teams (merge changes, see who did what, parallel development).
- Git saves the history of changes, making it easy to revert or review. Text editors only save the current state of a file.

## Knowledge Check Answers
1. **What kind of program is Git?**
   - Git is a version control system (VCS) that tracks the entire history of changes made to files and directories.
2. **Differences between Git and a text editor:**
   - Text editors only save the current state of a file, overwriting previous versions unless you manually create copies. Git saves every change as a snapshot, keeping a full history. You can view, compare, or restore any previous version at any time.
3. **Does Git work at a local or remote level?**
   - Git works at the local level; your commits, branches, and history are all managed on your own machine.
4. **Does GitHub work at a local or remote level?**
   - GitHub is a remote service—it stores your repositories online, enabling sharing and collaboration across different machines and users.
5. **Why is Git useful for developers?**
   - Track all changes and history in a project, revert to previous versions, see who made which changes, experiment safely without losing work.
6. **Why are Git and GitHub useful for a team of developers?**
   - Each developer can work independently on their own copy (branch or fork) of the repository. Git provides logical ways to merge changes and resolve conflicts. Git tracks who made each change, so you have a clear history of contributions. Multiple developers can work on different features or bug fixes simultaneously without overwriting each other’s work. GitHub acts as a central hub for sharing code, reviewing pull requests, and discussing changes before merging. Teams can use branching strategies to organize work and keep the main codebase stable. If something goes wrong, it’s easy to revert to a previous state or undo problematic changes.

## Python vs JS Notes
- Git and GitHub workflows are language-agnostic; you’ll use the same commands for JS as for Python.
- Most modern JS projects expect you to use Git and have a GitHub repo.
- Commit messages and branching are important for collaborative JS work.
