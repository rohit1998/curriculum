**Completed:** January 4, 2025

## Key Summary
- Simple lesson for macOS users: only need Google Chrome installed
- Development environment setup varies by OS (macOS, Linux, Windows, Chromebook)
- Google Chrome is the recommended browser for The Odin Project curriculum
- Chrome/Chromium dominates developer and consumer usage
- Chrome has best-in-class developer tools for web development

## Assignment Checklist
- [x] Check if running supported environment (macOS ✅)
- [x] Confirm Google Chrome is installed (already default browser ✅)

## Knowledge Check Answers
1. **What operating systems does The Odin Project support?**
   - macOS (fully supported)

## Python vs JS Notes
- Similar to Python development where you need specific tools (pip, conda, IDEs)
- Web development requires consistent browser environment for testing
- Chrome's developer tools will be essential for debugging (like using debuggers/profilers in Python)
- macOS advantage: no additional OS setup needed, just browser confirmation

## Key Insights
- **Already fully set up**: macOS + Chrome = ready to go
- **No installation needed**: Skipped all OS setup complexity
- **Developer tools**: Chrome's DevTools will be crucial for web development
- **Consistent environment**: Using recommended tools ensures smoother learning experience
