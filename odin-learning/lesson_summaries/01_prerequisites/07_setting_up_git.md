# Setting up Git

**Completed:** July 4, 2025

## Key Summary
- Git is a version control system for tracking code changes; GitHub is a web service for hosting Git repositories. They are separate tools.
- Installed Git and created a GitHub account (already done).
- Configured Git with user name, email, default branch (`main`), and pull behavior (`pull.rebase false`).
- Set up global ignore for `.DS_Store` files on macOS.
- Generated and linked SSH key with GitHub for secure authentication.

## Assignment Checklist
- [x] Install Git
- [x] Create a GitHub account
- [x] Configure Git (user name, email, default branch, pull behavior)
- [x] Set up global ignore for `.DS_Store` files (macOS)
- [x] Generate and add SSH key to GitHub
- [x] Test SSH connection

## Knowledge Check Answers
1. Git is the version control software; GitHub is a company/service that hosts Git repositories online.
2. Setting your user name and email in Git ensures your commits are properly attributed to you.
3. SSH keys allow secure, passwordless authentication with GitHub.
4. `.DS_Store` files are macOS metadata files and should be ignored globally to avoid cluttering repos.

## Python vs JS Notes
- Git and GitHub workflows are similar for Python and JS projects.
- SSH keys and global ignores are useful for any language or stack.
- Default branch naming (`main`) is a recent change; older Python repos may use `master`.

## Open Questions / Struggles
- None for this lesson.
